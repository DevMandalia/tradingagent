# Trading Bot Architecture Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a Bitcoin trading bot that interacts with the Binance API. The bot will utilize various technical indicators, candlestick pattern analysis, support and resistance levels, and other market metrics to make trading decisions.

## 2. Modules

The bot will be designed with a modular architecture to ensure clarity, maintainability, and extensibility. The core modules are:

### 2.1. API Interaction Module (`binance_connector.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**: 
    *   Establishing and maintaining a connection to the Binance API (both REST and WebSocket for real-time data where applicable).
    *   Fetching market data (k-lines/candlesticks, order book, ticker prices, funding rates).
    *   Placing, querying, and canceling orders.
    *   Retrieving account information (balances, trade history).
    *   Handling API errors, rate limits, and authentication.
*   **Key Functions**: `get_klines()`, `get_orderbook()`, `get_ticker()`, `get_funding_rate()`, `place_order()`, `cancel_order()`, `get_account_balance()`, `get_trade_history()`.

### 2.2. Data Processing Module (`data_processor.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Cleaning and transforming raw API data into a usable format (e.g., pandas DataFrames).
    *   Ensuring data integrity and handling missing data points.
    *   Preparing data for input into technical indicator and analysis modules.
*   **Key Functions**: `preprocess_klines_data()`, `format_orderbook_data()`.

### 2.3. Technical Indicators Module (`technical_indicators.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**: Calculating various technical indicators based on the processed market data.
*   **Indicators to Implement**:
    *   Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
    *   Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    *   Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch)
    *   Average Directional Index (ADX)
*   **Key Functions**: `calculate_macd()`, `calculate_rsi()`, `calculate_stochastic()`, `calculate_adx()`.

### 2.4. Candlestick Analysis Module (`candlestick_analyzer.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**: Identifying common candlestick patterns that may indicate potential price movements.
*   **Patterns to Consider**: Doji, Hammer/Hanging Man, Engulfing patterns, Morning/Evening Star, etc.
*   **Key Functions**: `identify_patterns()`.

### 2.5. Support and Resistance Module (`support_resistance.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**: Identifying potential support and resistance levels based on historical price data.
*   **Methods**: Pivot points, Fibonacci retracements, moving averages, psychological levels.
*   **Key Functions**: `find_support_levels()`, `find_resistance_levels()`.

### 2.6. Additional Metrics Module (`market_metrics.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**: Fetching and analyzing other relevant market metrics.
*   **Metrics to Include**:
    *   Funding Rates (for perpetual futures, if applicable, though the primary request is for Bitcoin trading which usually implies Spot. This needs clarification if Futures trading is intended).
    *   Order Book Analysis (depth, bid-ask spread, large orders).
    *   MVRV-Z Score (requires external data source or calculation if possible).
*   **Key Functions**: `get_funding_rates_data()` (if applicable), `analyze_orderbook()`, `get_mvrv_z_score()`.

### 2.7. Trading Logic Module (`trading_strategy.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**: 
    *   Aggregating signals from all analysis modules (technical indicators, candlestick patterns, S/R levels, other metrics).
    *   Implementing the core trading strategy to decide when to enter (buy) or exit (sell) a position.
    *   Defining entry and exit conditions based on a combination of signals.
*   **Key Functions**: `generate_buy_signal()`, `generate_sell_signal()`, `determine_trade_action()`.

### 2.8. Risk Management Module (`risk_manager.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Implementing risk management rules, such as stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, and position sizing.
    *   Calculating appropriate order sizes based on account balance and risk tolerance.
*   **Key Functions**: `calculate_position_size()`, `set_stop_loss()`, `set_take_profit()`.

### 2.9. Execution Module (`trade_executor.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Executing trades based on signals from the Trading Logic Module and parameters from the Risk Management Module.
    *   Interacting with the API Interaction Module to place and manage orders.
*   **Key Functions**: `execute_trade()`.

### 2.10. Logging and Reporting Module (`logger.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Logging all significant events, including API calls, errors, trading decisions, and executed trades.
    *   Generating performance reports (e.g., profit/loss, win rate).
*   **Key Functions**: `log_event()`, `log_trade()`, `generate_report()`.

### 2.11. Configuration Module (`config.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Storing and managing configuration parameters, such as API keys (securely), trading pairs, indicator settings, risk parameters, etc.
    *   Loading configuration from a file (e.g., JSON, YAML, or .env).
*   **Key Elements**: API_KEY, API_SECRET, TRADING_PAIR, RSI_PERIOD, MACD_FAST, MACD_SLOW, etc.

### 2.12. Main Orchestration Module (`main.py`)

*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Initializing all other modules.
    *   Running the main trading loop: fetch data, process data, analyze, make decisions, execute trades, log.
    *   Handling startup and shutdown procedures.

## 3. Data Flow

1.  **Configuration Module** provides settings to all other modules.
2.  **API Interaction Module** fetches raw market and account data from Binance.
3.  **Data Processing Module** cleans and formats the raw data.
4.  Processed data is fed into:
    *   **Technical Indicators Module**
    *   **Candlestick Analysis Module**
    *   **Support and Resistance Module**
    *   **Additional Metrics Module** (which may also fetch its own data via the API Interaction Module or other sources).
5.  The outputs (signals, levels, metrics) from these analysis modules are sent to the **Trading Logic Module**.
6.  The **Trading Logic Module** generates a trade decision (buy, sell, hold).
7.  If a trade is decided:
    *   The **Risk Management Module** determines position size, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.
    *   The **Execution Module** places the order via the **API Interaction Module**.
8.  All actions, decisions, and outcomes are recorded by the **Logging and Reporting Module**.
9.  The **Main Orchestration Module** controls this entire flow in a loop or based on scheduled intervals/events.

## 4. Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
*   **Key Libraries**:
    *   `requests` (for REST API calls)
    *   `websockets` (for WebSocket API, if used for real-time data)
    *   `pandas` (for data manipulation and analysis)
    *   `numpy` (for numerical operations)
    *   `TA-Lib` or other technical analysis libraries (for calculating indicators)
    *   A suitable plotting library (e.g., `matplotlib`, `plotly`) for potential visualization during development or reporting (optional for core bot logic).

## 5. Security Considerations

*   **API Keys**: Store API keys securely, never hardcode them. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system. Restrict API key permissions on Binance to only what is necessary (e.g., enable trading, disable withdrawals if bot doesn't need it).
*   **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially those coming from external sources or configuration files.
*   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.
*   **No Over-Privileges**: Run the bot with the least privileges necessary.

## 6. Future Enhancements

*   Backtesting module against historical data.
*   Machine learning integration for predictive modeling.
*   More sophisticated risk management strategies.
*   Support for multiple trading pairs or exchanges.
*   User interface for monitoring and control.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for developing the requested trading bot. Each module can be developed and tested independently before being integrated into the overall system.
